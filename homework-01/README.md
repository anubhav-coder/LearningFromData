# Homework 1

The code in this homework is for the questions #7 to #10, where you're
asked to implement the Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA).

## Perceptron Demo

Run `octave` and go to the `pla` directory using the `cd`
command. Then run:

    octave:1> pla_main

This will open a plot that looks like this:

## PLA Convergence And Probability Questions

You have to change the variable `N` to `10` and `100` on
`pla_convergence_main.m` and `pla_probability_main.m` and then run
each script like we did in with the perceptron demo above.
